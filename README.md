For now, this is a basic [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. I recommend installing

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for Windows users, or [installing git for Mac or Linux](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) that will work fine too
- [Node LTS](https://desktop.github.com/)

2. [Clone this repository](https://github.com/git-guides)

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

5. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
