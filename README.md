For now, this is a basic [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. I recommend installing:
   - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), and the [TailwindCSS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode), [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), and [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) extensions.
   - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for Windows users, or [install git for Mac or Linux](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
   - [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) **REQUIRED** to do anything with this project

2. [Clone this repository](https://github.com/git-guides)

3. Run the development server: `npm run dev` in your command line. You can click the terminal button in VSCode or Webstorm to open a new session.

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

5. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

6. When you are satisfied with your changes, create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) and wait for it to be reviewed and acted upon.

#### I want more POWER!
Besides the regular installations, there are more powerful tools that cost money but are free for students (which I assume all of you are). 
   - [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is a powerful editor that has many features that VSCode does not. It also works out of the box for our purposes instead of having to install plugins. Apply for the license [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).
   - [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) is an AI powered tool that automatically autocompletes your code and can even generate whole blocks using comments. Apply for the license [here](https://education.github.com/students).
